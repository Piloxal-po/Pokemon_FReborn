Modding
-------

Files in the patch directory override the files from the base game. This should work for all files in Audio, Graphics, Fonts and Data directories.

Scripts cannot be overrided this way, but you can add extra scripts by adding them into patch/Mods directory (works exactly the same as the old Data/Mods folder, just in a different location).

For example, patch/Graphics/Battlers/bulbasaur.png would take precedence over the normal Graphics/Battlers/bulbasaur.png.
You can use this for custom shinies or any other mods, instead of replacing the files in-game. 
Note that any file structure beyond the main directory (reborn folder / patch directory) has to be copied exactly, in addition to the file name, for the game to recognize your changes.

This should be the preferred way to install mods from now on. Do not replace base game files if you don't have to.
